Focus: A single server and its context
	As we expect the client to be developed by a third party, we need to be able to cope with their
	protocol type, by using a user defined one.
	Its easier to communicate with other R:S servers, so let's define our own interface for that.
	(In most cases, you would simply set up the server telling it what kind of interface definition to use for what kind of connection)
	Also, there might be the need to have serveral connections with other servers through several different interfaces.
	(That is why we need to carefully generalize the manager that will laterone handle sockets and connections)
	Last but not least, if there is need for a database, we will have to use 3rd party tools. (Like MySQL interfaces etc.)

	Note that more context might be a local/remote terminal, or a http based status port. (E.g. for monitoring)
