From overview to context:
	A client is connected two one or more servers from the server level.
	A server may (!) be connected to one or more other servers, and/or a database server
	from the data level.

An example:
	In GuildWars 1, the client maintains more than only one connection.
	It loads new content from a file server, which is no real part of the actual server
	cluster.
	It authorizes at the Auth Server, which then redirects it to a valid Game/Map Server.
	We expect each server of the cluster to maintain a connection to a database,
	and we also expect the auth server to manage the game servers.
	There should be more than one auth server, so that may be a cluster as well.
	(devided in regions?)

Back to the more general version:
	The following interfaces may exist, and require some regard:
		- Client <-1--<>--n-> Server 	(note that this one must be very carefully defineable:
						 e.g. does GW1 have a very special protocol)
		- Server <-m--<>--m-> Server	(note that servers may have different roles
						 in that case, we may need either a more general interface,
						 or several different interfaces)
		- Server <-k--<>--l-> DataBase	(there may be several databases connected to several servers)
